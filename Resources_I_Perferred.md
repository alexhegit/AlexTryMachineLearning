Record the userful Resources of ML I saw. 

I put a (1-5) recommend level after each resource I deep used or readed.

- humphd/have-fun-with-machine-learning (5)

This is a hands-on guide to machine learning for programmers with no background in AI. It guide you using NVIDIA/DIGITS to train the CNN caffe mode examples(AlexNet & GoogleNet) step step. I open the door of ML/DL through this project.
